How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was helpful because it only showed the differences between the two files, easing the locals to search for.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It can help me search for old implementations looking for a bug or how things were implemented before change.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because they were built with differents purposes. Git was created towards codes edition, and codes have
    dependencies between each other. Google Docs is used to edit standalone documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use git log to search for a specific modification and git diff to make a comparation and see what
    has been modified

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It makes a lot more confident once if I mess around I retrieve a version that was working.
